        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Whiskers Rescue Cafe is more than just a cozy spot for coffee-it's a second chance for cats in need. Our mission is to provide a safe, loving space for rescue cats while giving our community a place to relax, connect, and maybe even find a new furry friend to adopt.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2023 by passionate animal loveres, we started as a small local rescue that dreamed of creating a space where people could enjoy delicious drinks and spend time with adoptable cats. Now, we've grown into a vibrant hub where lives are changed-one purr at a time.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>When you visit our cafe, you can sip your favorite drink while lounging with our adoptable cats. Each cat has its own personality, and our trained staff is here to help you meet your perfect match if you're considering adoption.</p>
